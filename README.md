# modbus-arduino-2
Second library needed to use arduino as a modbus slave through usb

This library provides the `ModbusSerial.cpp` and `ModbusSerial.h` files, needed to run a modbus slave(server) on an arduino with USB serial capabilities. A second library, which provides `Modbus.ccp` and `Modbus.h` is needed.
This are forked from [here](https://github.com/andresarmento/modbus-arduino), but are in a separate repo so that I can pull them as dependencies in Platformio.
